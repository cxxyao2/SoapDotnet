In the context of XML, **WSDL** stands for **Web Services Description Language**. It is an XML-based format used to describe web services and how they can be accessed. Specifically, it provides a model for describing the network endpoints (or services) in a standardized way, making it easier for different systems to communicate over the web.

### Key Points of WSDL:

1. **XML-based**: WSDL documents are written in XML, which makes them platform-independent and machine-readable.
2. **Service Description**: It defines web services, including the operations they perform and how to communicate with them.
3. **SOAP Protocol**: WSDL is often used in conjunction with the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) messaging protocol, though it can describe services over other protocols (e.g., HTTP).
4. **Structure**:
   - **Types**: Defines the data types (often using XML Schema) that are used by the service.
   - **Messages**: Defines the data elements of each operation.
   - **Port Types**: Groups of operations that can be performed by the service.
   - **Bindings**: Describes the protocol and data format to be used.
   - **Service**: Specifies where the service can be accessed, typically via a URL.

### Example of WSDL in XML:

```xml
<definitions xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/"
             xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/"
             xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
             targetNamespace="http://example.com/wsdl">

  <types>
    <xs:schema>
      <xs:element name="request" type="xs:string"/>
      <xs:element name="response" type="xs:string"/>
    </xs:schema>
  </types>

  <message name="RequestMessage">
    <part name="parameters" element="tns:request"/>
  </message>

  <message name="ResponseMessage">
    <part name="parameters" element="tns:response"/>
  </message>

  <portType name="ExamplePortType">
    <operation name="ExampleOperation">
      <input message="tns:RequestMessage"/>
      <output message="tns:ResponseMessage"/>
    </operation>
  </portType>

  <binding name="ExampleBinding" type="tns:ExamplePortType">
    <soap:binding style="rpc" transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http"/>
    <operation name="ExampleOperation">
      <soap:operation soapAction="http://example.com/ExampleOperation"/>
      <input>
        <soap:body use="literal"/>
      </input>
      <output>
        <soap:body use="literal"/>
      </output>
    </operation>
  </binding>

  <service name="ExampleService">
    <port name="ExamplePort" binding="tns:ExampleBinding">
      <soap:address location="http://example.com/ExampleService"/>
    </port>
  </service>
</definitions>
```

In this WSDL document, a web service called `ExampleService` is described. It has a port type (`ExamplePortType`) with an operation (`ExampleOperation`) that expects a request and returns a response, using SOAP as the communication protocol.

### WSDL's Role:

WSDL acts as the "contract" for web services, allowing service providers and consumers to interact without needing to know internal implementations.
